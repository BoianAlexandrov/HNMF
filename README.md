# GreenNMF
GreenNMF is  Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) coupled with inverse-analysis Green's functions method. GreenNMF synergistically performs decomposition of the recorded be sensors mixtures, finds the number of the unknown sources and uses the Green's function of advection-diffusion equation to identify their characteristics.  GreenNFM code presented here is capable of identifying the advection velocity (the direction of the advection velocity is assumed on the axis x) and dispersivity of the medium as well as the unknown number, locations, and properties of release sources with different space and time dependences only based on the recorded contaminant mixtures. GreenNMF can be applied directly to any problem controlled by a partial-differential parabolic equation where mixtures of an unknown number of sources are measured at multiple locations.
